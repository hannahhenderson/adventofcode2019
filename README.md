For more, check out @technomancy's [Leiningen Tutorial](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#running-code).

Assuming you've got lein installed, `cd` into the project and run:
```
lein repl 
```

I use IntelliJ + Cursive and their built in REPL tools, and tend to configure my IDE to connect to the nrepl port that's generated with `lein repl`.
